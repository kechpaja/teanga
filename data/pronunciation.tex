*these sounds don't occur in English. However, they aren't that hard to master; also, \^h is very rare in Esperanto, and you probably won't have to worry about it for a while. It's possible to speak the language without dealing with this phoneme. However, r and c are all over the place. 

~\

Finally, the stress in an Esperanto word always comes on the second-to-last syllable. This rule is always consistant, without fail. The letters never change their pronunciations --- you don't have to worry about ``I before E except after C" or anything of the sort.
