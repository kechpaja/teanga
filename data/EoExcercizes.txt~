Here are our most basic plans for the lesson structure of our project. It hasn't been fully fleshed out yet, but there is a skeleton of everything that we intend to make, with the exception of potential future lessons. 


"X-notation" will be a valid input scheme for our program, but it will be converted to regular Eo orthography before being displayed, as the user types. Example: if you type "sxi", the "sx" will be converted to "ŝ" as soon as you hit the "i" key. 


Lesson Zero: Greetings!

"Vocab":
Saluton!
Ĝis! / Ĝis la revido!
Kio estas via nomo? Kiel vi fartas?

(There won't be any grammar here; there's nothing really to put in a grammar section. Instead, we can have a pronunciation section to get people used to how Eo feels to pronounce.)

Pronunciation and Alphabet:

Display each letter with it's name, pronunciation (IPA and soundbyte), and an example word.


Lesson One: Questions, pronouns, and verbs.

Vocabulary: 
Pronouns: mi, vi, li/ŝi/ĝi, (ri?), ni, ili; poss
Correlatives: kio/kia, tio/tia
Nouns: nomo, kato, muso, hundo, ; a few other simple nouns
Verbs: voli, esti, manĝi, ami, iri, skribi
Phrases: Kio estas tio?

Kio estas tio? What is that? / What is this? (Show a picture, and ask this question for each word)

For the excercize portion of this section ("tetris"), there will be a question at the top of the page (maybe), and as pictures descend, the user will have to answer that question about the pictures. ("Kio estas tio?"). 


Grammar: present tense of verbs; infinitive and when to use it. 

- Slide 1 - In English, verbs change their form ("inflect", as linguists say) when used with singular versus plural subjects, or when they occur after another verb. In Esperanto, verbs also inflect. However, they do not inflect in the same way as verbs in English do. Look at the following examples, and see if you can figure out how Esperanto verbs work before moving on to the next page:

Mia nomo estas _____. / My name is _____. 
La katoj estas en la domo. / The cats are in the house. 
Mi vidas vin. / I see you. 
Mi volas iri. / I want to go. 

- Slide 2 - Well, let's see - did you figure it out? 

In Esperanto, verbs do not change form for singular and plural subjects, the way they do in English. Verbs in Esperanto always end in -as when used in the present tense with a subject. See the examples again, this time with text highlighting:

Mia nomo estAS _____. / My name IS _____. 
La katoj estAS en la domo. / The cats ARE in the house. 
Mi vidAS vin. / I see you.

- Slide 3 -

But what about the verbs ending in -i, you ask? Well, they have a function too. They're called "infinitives". The infinitive of a verb is used in dictionary headwords, and when the verb is used with another verb, rather than taking a noun as subject. 
 
Mi volas irI. / I want to go. 
Li volas manĝI. / He wants to eat. 


Exercises (drag and drop a morpheme into the blank):

Choose the correct verb ending:

La domo est__ bela. (Show a picture of a house...)

Mi vol__ manĝ_. (some picture)

La hundo ir__ en la domon. ("the dog is going to the house")

Ŝi skrib__. ("She is writing")


(etc.)


"Boss": interactive game, advancing the plot. Fairly simple, "80's-esque" game. 



Lesson Two: Around the house? Free Time?



Lesson Three: Grocery Shopping

Vocab: fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy

Grammar:
