data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~All verbs in esperanto in the present tense end in "as." This means that, if you want to make a statement about the present, you can take the verb form ending in "i" and replace it with "as". Unlike in English, there are no irregular verbs in Esperanto - all verbs are treated the same when conjugated.~La hundo estAS bruna.
data/VocabPictures/muso.jpg~Adjectives, such as "malgranda" (small) and "amuza" (funny), end in "a" in the nominative case (we'll get to case later - don't worry if you don't know what it means). This is true regardless of the noun modified - there is no gender agreement (adjectives must agree in case and number, but again, we'll get to that later). In Esperanto, unlike in English, asjectives come after the noun rather than before it. Thus, we say "La kato bela" rather than "La bela kato".~La muso amuzA estas malgrandA.
data/VocabPictures/eat.jpeg~The verb form ending in "i" that you see in the vocab lists is called the infinitive. It is equivalent to the form of a verb beginning with "to" in English. It has a number of different uses, but for now you'll be using it after verbs like "want" which are followed by another verb. ~Mi volas manĝi.

data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~Esperanto has a nominative and accusative case. This means a noun looks different when it is the subject of a verb and when it is the object, much like the pronouns "I" and "me" in English. The nominative case is just the form of the noun that you see in the dictionary, whereas the accusative case is formed by adding "-n" to the nominative.~"li ŝatas la kato"/"la kato ŝatas lin"
