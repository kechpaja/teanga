data/VocabPictures/kato.jpg~One short word that you should know, and will likely use continually in your study of Esperanto, is the article "la", which means "the". It is used in much the same way as its English equivalent, although there are a few nuances that you will pick up as you go along. Also, although we haven't gotten to agreement yet, it's worth mentioning that "la" does not agree with its noun - that means that "la" will always be "la", and never change form, no matter what else may change in the sentence. ~LA kato estas bela.
data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~All verbs in esperanto in the present tense end in "as." This means that, if you want to make a statement about the present, you can take the verb form ending in "i" and replace it with "as". Unlike in English, there are no irregular verbs in Esperanto - all verbs are treated the same when conjugated.~La hundo estAS bruna.
data/VocabPictures/muso.jpg~Adjectives, such as "malgranda" (small) and "amuza" (funny), end in "a" in the nominative case (we'll get to case later - don't worry if you don't know what it means). This is true regardless of the noun modified - there is no gender agreement (adjectives must agree in case and number, but again, we'll get to that later). In Esperanto, unlike in English, asjectives come after the noun rather than before it. Thus, we say "La kato bela" rather than "La bela kato".~La muso amuzA estas malgrandA.
data/VocabPictures/eat.jpeg~The verb form ending in "i" that you see in the vocab lists is called the infinitive. It is equivalent to the form of a verb beginning with "to" in English. It has a number of different uses, but for now you'll be using it after verbs like "want" which are followed by another verb. ~Mi volas manĝi.

data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~Esperanto has a nominative and accusative case. This means a noun looks different when it is the subject of a verb and when it is the object, in the same way as the pronouns "I" and "me" are different in English. The nominative case is just the form of the noun that you see in the dictionary, whereas the accusative case is formed by adding "-n" to the nominative.~li ŝatas la katon./la kato ŝatas lin.
data/VocabPictures/eat.jpg~Have you been wondering, in your studies so far, how Esperanto handles plurals? Well, if so, you're about to find out. Plurals in Esperanto are much simpler than in English - whereas in English you encounter words such as "goose" whose plural form is irregular, in Esperanto plurals are always formed in the same way. A plural noun ends in -j, which, when combined with the final -o present on all Esperanto nouns, is pronounced as the "oy" in "boy". The same suffix is used to pluralize adjectives, although the resulting ending is pronounced "eye" instead. The article does not change in the plural, nor do verbs. ~La katoj manĝas muson.
data/VocabPictures/eat.jpg~A note on plurals and the accusative case: when you add the accusative suffix to the plural form of a word, it is simply added on to the end, as another suffix. Thus, "musoj" becomes "musojn", and "belaj" becomes "belajn". If you've studies Latin, which has a separate form for all four of the possible case and number combinations dealt with here, you'll see that the Esperanto way of doing this is far simpler. ~La katoj manĝas musojn.

data/VocabPictures/gimme.jpg~Now for the lesson we know you've all been waiting for - how to boss people around! (or not - in fact, we'd rather you not.) But right now, we're going to study the Esperanto imperative, which is linguist-speak for the form of the verb that you use when giving a command or making a (forceful) request. Do you remember how we formed the present tense, by removing the final -i of the infinitive (dictionary form) of the verb, and replacing it with -as? Well, to form the imperative, we again remove the -i, but instead of -as, we replace it with -u. It's as simple as that! ~Donu ĝin al mi!
data/VocabPictures/kato.jpg~Although you're probably busy giving people orders now, there's still material to cover in this section. We're going to go over questions, so you can ask people if they're okay with being bossed around before you do so. (Or not. Your call.) Yes/no questions in Esperanto are similar to those of English - you just take the original sentence, and add the word "ĉu" at the beginning, without moving any of the words around (Linguists may want to object to this description, but please bear with me; it makes more sense to the vast majority of the population). This little word, or "particle" as it's called officially, is basically equivalent to the English word "do" when used to introduce a question. Easy, enit? ~Ĉu vi parolas Esperanton?

data/VocabPictures/kato.jpg~Now that we've started learning about expressions relating to time, it's about time (pun intended!) to start thinking about tenses. Unlike English's multiple, complex tenses and rules for how and when to use them, Esperanto has a comparatively simple system consisting of three tenses (present, past, and future), one of which you already know (the present). Just as verbs in the present tense replace their infinitive suffix -i with the present tense suffix -as, verbs in the past and future tenses replace the -i with -is and -os, respectively. Thus, "was" and "were" translate to "estis", and "will be" translates to "estos". Note that there is no Esperanto word corresponding to the English auxiliary "will", since the future tense is indicated directly by a suffix. ~Mi manĝos la
