How to use this program:

Upon launching the software, you'll be prompted to either select your username from the list of existing users, or to create a new user if this is your first time using the software. Should you need to create a new user, simply click on the "new user" button, and choose a username and password. 


Typing Esperanto letters with the circumflex and breve (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ):

Esperanto uses several letters with what linguists call "diacritical marks", or "diacritics" for short, on top. These letters are ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ, in both lower and upper case. You are welcome and encouraged to figure out how to type these characters directly on your computer; however, we have provided a simple solution to that problem if you would rather not. Historically, when such accented characters have not been available, Esperanto speakers have instead typed the base letter followed by an "x" - for example, "mangxas" instead of "manĝas". We have taken this convention one step further: if you type any of C, G, H, J, S, or U, in either case, followed by an "x", the combination will be replaced by the proper accented character. 


Program files:

This program requires a number of data files (in the "data" folder) - they are provided for you, and need not and should not ever be modified. Please don't mess with them; you'll only be hurting yourself by messing up your program.
