data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~All verbs in esperanto in the present tense end in "as." This means that, if you want to make a statement about the present, you can take the verb form ending in "i" and replace it with "as."~La hundo estAS bruna.
data/VocabPictures/muso.jpg~Adjectives, such as "malgranda" (small) and "amuza" (funny), end in "a." This is true no matter what noun they are modifying. In Esperanto, unlike in English, asjectives come after the noun rather than before it. Thus, we say "La kato bela" rather than "La bela kato".~La muso amuzA estas malgrandA.
data/VocabPictures/eat.jpeg~The verb form ending in "i" that you see in the vocab lists is called the infinitive. It is equivalent to the form of a verb beginning with "to" in English. It has many uses, but for now you'll be using it after verbs like "want" which are followed by another verb.~Mi volas manƒùi.

data/VocabPictures/hundo.jpg~Esperanto has a nominative and accusative case. This means a noun looks different when it is the subject of a verb and when it is the object, much like the pronouns "I" and "me" in English. The nominative case is just the form of the noun that you see in the dictionary, whereas the accusative case is formed by adding "-n" to the nominative.~"li satas la kato"/"la kato satas gin"
