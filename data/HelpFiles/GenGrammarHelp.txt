This game will test your knowledge of the grammar taught in this level. You'll be shown a picture and given a sentence related to that picture. The sentence will have one or more blanks which you need to fill in from the appropriate tiles below.

Simply drag and drop the tiles to the appropriate spots and press submit. If you're correct, you'll be taken to the next sentence. If not, you'll be required to try again. 

If you get stuck, you can use the dictionary and help buttons for a small point deduction.

You can skip any given sentence, but this may make it difficult to get a high enough score to unlock the Boss level.

Bonan sorton!
