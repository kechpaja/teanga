MUST BE COMPLETED FOR DEMO
(This stuff must be finished, at the absolute latest, by the time we go to bed on Friday)

Kelvin:
-completed pictures for vocab for each level, in correct file in correct input format (~25 per level)
-all boss exercizes written and in correct file in correct input (15 pre level, exactly)
-all boss level pictures found (one per level)
-create README
-create pronunciation guide
-add "Thank you!" to lessons???

Danielle:
-better error handling in case an image isn't found

Tara:

Annie:
-fix vocab game


SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY DEMO
(Ideally, this stuff should be finished by Friday night as well, although falling back a bit to Saturday is fine)

Kelvin:
-add complementizers to the parser
-put prepositions and correlatives in something other than hard-coded

Rest: (organize based off of how quickly we each finish our MUST BE COMPLETED sections)
-Stars/checks/some way of indicating which games are completed
-Some way of indicating best score/necessary score in games
-alphabetize dictionary



WOULD BE NICE TO BE COMPLETED BY DEMO:
(If this stuff doesn't happen, life will go one)

Everyone:
-loading Bar
-suggest code for dictionary



FINAL STUFF:
-when we're confident: delete commented out blocks o' code
-Remove unnecessary files/clean files that should be empty for first use
