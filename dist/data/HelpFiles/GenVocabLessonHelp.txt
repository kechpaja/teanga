This game will test your knowledge of the vocabulary learned in this lesson. Pictures associated with the vocabulary you have learned will be falling from the top of the screen, and you will have to give the vocabulary.

There is a text box at the bottom of the screen; as pictures drop, simply enter the vocab word and press return. If you're right, the picture should disappear. If not, it will continue to fall.

Eventually, as the pictures fall faster and faster, they will pile up on the bottom of the screen. The game will be over once they reach the top. You must always name the bottom-most picture, but if you get stuck you can use the dictionary for a minor point deduction.

The dictionary and help box will pause the game for as long as they are open. 

If you don't recognize the falling picture, you can press 7 and the English word the picture represents will appear.

You'll need a score of at least 100 to move onto the Boss level. 

Bona sorto!
